# SPI_PROTOCOL
Our project aims to create a SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) module by using VerilogHDL. SPI is a synchronous Serial Communication protocol used for short-distance communication,primarily in embedded systems. It is a full-duplex communication protocol, so that we created both modules used in it such as "SPI MASTER" module and "SPI SLAVE" module.
