# SPI_PROTOCOL
**Overview**  
This project implements a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) master module in Verilog, along with a testbench to simulate and verify its functionality. The SPI master module can communicate with an SPI slave device by sending and receiving 8-bit data.

**SPI Protocol**
SPI is a synchronous serial communication protocol used for short-distance communication, primarily in embedded systems. It consists of four main signals:

-SCLK (Serial Clock): Clock signal generated by the master.
-MOSI (Master Out Slave In): Data line for data sent from the master to the slave.
-MISO (Master In Slave Out): Data line for data sent from the slave to the master.
-SS (Slave Select): Line to select the slave device.


**Module Description**

_spi_master.v_

The spi_master module implements the SPI master functionality. It includes:

-Clock and reset inputs.
-Data input to send to the slave and data output to receive from the slave.
-SPI clock (SCLK), master out slave in (MOSI), master in slave out (MISO), and slave select (SS) signals.
-Configurable clock phase (cpha) and clock polarity (cpol) for SPI communication.

_Ports_

input wire clk: System clock.
input wire reset: System reset.
input wire [7:0] data_in: Data to be sent to the slave.
output reg [7:0] data_out: Data received from the slave.
output reg SCLK: SPI clock.
output reg MOSI: Master Out Slave In.
input wire MISO: Master In Slave Out.
output reg SS: Slave Select.
input cpha: Clock phase.
input cpol: Clock polarity.
_
Internal Registers_

reg [3:0] bit_cnt: Bit counter to keep track of the number of bits sent/received.
reg [7:0] shift_reg: Shift register to hold the data during transmission.


**spi_master_tb.v** 

The Master_tb module is a testbench used to simulate the spi_master module. It generates clock and reset signals, provides input data, and monitors the output data.

_Signals_

reg clk: Clock signal.
reg reset: Reset signal.
reg [7:0] data_in: Data to be sent to the slave.
wire [7:0] data_out: Data received from the slave.
wire SCLK: SPI clock.
wire MOSI: Master Out Slave In.
reg MISO: Master In Slave Out.
wire SS: Slave Select.
reg [7:0] data_slave: Data received from the slave.
reg cpha: Clock phase.
reg cpol: Clock polarity.

**Clock Generation**

A clock signal with a 10 ns period (100 MHz) is generated using an initial block.

**Test Procedure**

Initialize signals and assert reset.
Set data to be sent by the master.
Deassert reset and start SPI communication.
Simulate data received from the slave.
Finish simulation.

**Waveform**

The waveform diagram shows the SPI communication between the master and the slave. It includes signals such as MISO, MOSI, SCLK, SS, bit_cnt, clk, data_in, data_out, reset, shift_reg, and data_slave. The waveform helps to visualize the timing and behavior of the SPI master during data transmission and reception.

**Conclusion**


This project provides a simple implementation of an SPI master in Verilog. The testbench allows for simulation and verification of the SPI communication with a slave device. The waveform visualization helps to understand the timing and behavior of the SPI signals.
